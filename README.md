# TriviaGame

The purpose of this game is to create a time based trivia game.

There will be a setIntervalId that will tick down from a set time.

At the end of the timer, the game will switch screens showing correct, wrong, and unanswered answers.

Ideally, it will also show the correct answers but that will be an option added after the game is completed and working.
